# Digital Self Toolkit

Here you will find some trusted starter code to download/access personal data from different sources.

Create a new Python venv and install requirements.txt. Then run `npm install` for the TS/JS data importers. Then look at the README files in each subdirectory to get started.

WARNING: These scripts download personal data to files. I did my best to download to .gitignored locations BUT ALWAYS CHECK BEFORE YOU COMMIT TO MAKE SURE NO PERSONAL DATA IS COMMITTED TO ANY FORK YOU MAKE OF THIS REPO.
